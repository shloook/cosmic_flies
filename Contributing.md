## 🧭 Contribution Guidelines

### ✔ Coding Style & Best Practices  
- Follow the project’s minimal, clean aesthetic.  
- Keep DOM updates and animation loops efficient.  
- Name variables and functions clearly (e.g., `initParticles`, `updateMotion`).  
- Keep assets and files organized (e.g., scripts in `script.js`, visuals in `dd.webp`, etc.).  
- Avoid large dependencies if unnecessary — the project aims to stay lightweight.

### ✔ Commit Message Style  
Use descriptive, concise messages:
- `Add: new glow-trail effect`  
- `Fix: particle overflow on small screens`  
- `Update: README with customization instructions`

### ✔ Pull Request Checklist  
Before submitting your PR:
- Animation runs smoothly and without errors in console  
- Visual appearance remains acceptable on different screen sizes  
- Added code is commented where complex logic occurs  
- Existing features remain unchanged unless intentionally modified  
- Documentation (README.md, comments) updated if needed

## 🐛 Reporting Issues  
If you find a bug or unexpected behavior:
- Search existing issues to see if it’s already known  
- If new, open an issue with:  
  - A clear title  
  - Description of the problem  
  - Steps to reproduce (browser, version, resolution might help)  
  - Screenshots or GIFs if helpful  
- If you want to propose a new feature, see the Feature Requests section below

## 💡 Feature Requests  
We’d love to hear your ideas! Please include:
- Brief summary of what you’d like to see

- Potential priority: low / medium / high

## 🔀 Branching Strategy  
- `main` → stable version / production  
- `feature/*` → new features or enhancements  
- `bugfix/*` → direct fixes to known issues  
- `docs/*` → updates to documentation only  
Branches should be created from `main`.
